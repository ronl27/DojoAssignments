<!-- JavaScript
You can do the javascript as an included file, e.g. <script src = "myfile.js"></script> or inside <script> My angular js code here</script>

Create an angular module named app. Create an angular controller named divController that is a property of the app module. Have it include the $scope dependency.   -->

<!-- HTML
Have the scope of the whole module extend from html tag to /html Have the scope of the divController extend from a div in the body to the end of that div. (The end of the scope is automatically generated by where you start the scope). -->

<!-- Return to JavaScript
In the body of the controller function, create some variables:
$scope.myName = 'your name'; // your name!
$scope.myFavoriteLanguage = 'JavaScript';
$scope.myFavoriteJSLibrary = 'Angular'; -->

<!-- Return to your HTML and figure out some way to access those variables you declared.
hint: ejs used <%= %>, PHP uses <?= ?>, Jinja2 uses {{ }}, etc.

With angular, these bindings are linked to the scope of the directive

Angular also has directives that might do it -->

<!-- Have your div that is controlled by your controller have the text of something akin to: “Hello my name is Jessica, my favorite Language is JavaScript, because the Angular library is awesome”. Where Jessica, JavaScript, and Angular are all populated by the controller based on the values you initially input. -->
